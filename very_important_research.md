# Title
Recordings of hamburger diameters at common highstreet fast-food outlets

# Abstract
Summarise main findings so people cite your paper without having to read it.

# Introduction
We present the measurements of the varying diameters of burgers purchased from an array of common highstreet fast-food outlets.
This is in order to properly inform customers of potential value for money (McDonald et al 2004).
King et al (1998) conducted several studies in this area revealing potential savings during midnight hunger cravings on a night out can be substantial.

# Simulations
We simulate the changes in relish to burger surface area ratio according to the model by Wendy.S.

# Methodology
We compared simulations from Castle et al with our measurements.
Very precise measurements were required (burger patties were viewed under an electron microscope).

# Results
Our simulations and measurements indicate that hamburger growth is dominated by pressure from hungry phd students.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the burgeoning science of burger dynamics. Nonetheless, hamburgers remain uneaten, so we should definitely get more ketchup.

We would like to thank the Hamburglar for not stealing all of our research samples.
