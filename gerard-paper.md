# Title
Measurement - model comparison of biomass burning aerosol aging over West Africa

# Abstract
Summarise the main findings here.

# Introduction section
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured a PCASP, as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Smith et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region before,
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of BBOA over W Africa, using John's model.

# Methodology
We compared simulations from model Y (Smith et al, 2005) with our measurements.

# Results
Our simulations and measurements indicate particle growth is dominated by coagulation.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process.
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.

# Figures
Add figures here. It's a draft.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our EU funding body.
